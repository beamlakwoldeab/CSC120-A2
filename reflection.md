What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For me, this project allowed me to gain an insight into what object oriented thinking is in programming. I realized that I need to pay close attention to the demands of the assignment, since I totally did not pay attention to the fact that we had to submit a reflection as well as a self assessment rubric, having been too immersed in the coding section of the assignment. I also learned how it feels to be thrust into a new programming method, and how to ask for help and how to make my questions clear.
